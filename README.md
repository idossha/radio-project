### 1. Inspiration:

Family reached out inquiring about the possibility of building her a simple crude radio receiver.

### 2. Conceptualization:

- simple, small, 9V battery operated.
- should seem like DIY device
- Should receive FM signals and output good quality signal

### 3. Minimum Viable Product:

#### Hardware:

- [ ] Microcontroller (Arduino Nano works well)

- [ ] [FM Radio Module:](https://www.ebay.com/itm/310795359575)

- [ ] [Nokia 5110 LCD:](https://www.ebay.com/itm/400488314619?hash=item5d3ef6b6fb%3Ag%3AuNYAAOSw2GlXHye0&siteid=0&customid=&toolid=20012)

- [ ] 10K Potentiometer: already have \*2

- [ ] [Audio Amplifier:](https://www.ebay.com/itm/404836913275)

- [ ] [3W Speaker:](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/CMS-402811-28SP/10821307)

- [ ] breadboard / prefboard for prototyping

- [ ] [Audio Cable:](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tensility-international-corp/10-00344/2350247)

- [ ] Jumper Wires

### Iterative Design:
